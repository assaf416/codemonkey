Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

Your RailsDevs subscription is cancelled and you will no longer be billed. You can continue to access the site until the end of your billing period.

I hope this comes with good news! Did you make a hire? Fill out this form and Iâ€™ll send you info on next steps: <%= new_businesses_hiring_invoice_request_url %>

A friendly reminder about the signed hiring agreement. You must notify RailsDevs of any hires no later than the developer's first day of work: <%= hiring_agreement_terms_url %>

<%= render "shared/signature" %>
